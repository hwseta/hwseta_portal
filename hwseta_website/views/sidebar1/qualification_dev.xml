												<h2>Occupational Qualification: Health Promotion Officer (Community
													Health Worker) SAQA ID 94597 Registered</h2>
												<p>The skills development landscape in South Africa is one that
													requires constant change and innovative thinking on the part of
													Sector Education Training Authorities (SETAs) to meet the needs of
													the sectors they serve. The HWSETA is no exception and it is this
													mindset that resulted in the establishment of the Qualification
													Development and Maintenance (QDM) sub-division in October 2013 to
													focus on this key area of responsibility for the HWSETA.</p>
												<p>“The delivery of quality training in South Africa requires a
													combination of accredited training providers that are able to
													deliver excellent quality training content and material,” comments
													Champa Gopal, Qualification Development and Maintenance Manager for
													the HWSETA. “By assessing and maintaining quality in these two
													critical areas, learners in South Africa are assured that the
													training they receive will enable them to make a positive
													contribution to the skills pool in the health and social
													development sectors.”</p>
												<p>Since its establishment, the QDM sub-division has approached the
													task at hand with zest and the hard work is paying off.</p>
												<p>The QDM sub-division, in partnership with the National Department
													of Health (NDOH) and International Training Education Centre for
													Health (I-TECH), has been successful at registering the
													Occupational Qualification: Health Promotion Officer (Community
													Health Worker) SAQA ID 94597 in November 2014. This qualification
													replaces three community health work (CHW) legacy qualifications in
													the form of CHW levels 2, 3 and 4.</p>
												<p>The HWSETA will not accredit private skills development providers
													(SDPs) for this newly registered occupational qualification and
													this is a function that will reside with the Quality Council for
													Trades Occupation (QCTO). Accreditation of providers by the QCTO
													will be dependent on the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding
													with the National Department of Health (NDOH) ensuring the learner
													has a designated workplace with a mentor during the time of study
													to obtain the required workplace experience.</p>
												<p>Ms. Gopal adds that the accreditation processes for legacy
													qualifications will remain with the HWSETA and this should not be
													confused with the accreditation processes outlined by QCTO for
													registered occupational qualifications.</p>
												<p>The HWSETA conducted workshops nationally to inform its
													stakeholder base of this shift in accreditation and implementation
													processes for this new occupational qualification, as well as
													qualifications that will be developed in future.</p>
												<p>To date the QCTO has successfully accredited twelve regional
													training centers attached to the NDOH. A partnership pilot training
													project for 900 learners in twelve regional training centres
													commenced in March 2015.</p>
												<p>Whilst the HWSETA will not be responsible for the accreditation
													Skills Development Providers for this occupational qualification,
													it has received approval from the QCTO to be the Assessment Quality
													Partner (AQP). As an AQP, the HWSETA is responsible for setting up
													final external summative examinations, co-ordination of national
													examinations through approved assessment centers, as well as
													assessment and recommendation of learner certification to QCTO.</p>
												<p>The examination process and logistical arrangements will be
													conducted through partnerships with Community of Experts (CEP’s) to
													ensure seamless quality processes are applied. The ETQA will
													timeously announce all examination logistics.</p>
												<p>“This is an important milestone for the HWSETA and we believe
													that what we have learnt during this process will pave the way for
													the development of occupational qualifications that will replace
													the thirty three legacy qualifications that the HWSETA is mandated
													to quality assure,” adds Ms Gopal.</p>
												<p>The HWSETA has submitted the occupational qualification, Social
													Auxiliary Work to QCTO for registration with SAQA and is currently
													awaiting the outcome of this occupational qualification.</p>
												<p>Within the next five years the HWSETA intends having all legacy
													qualifications re-curriculated into qualifications that will
													translate into occupations and ultimately provide the youth of the
													country an opportunity to follow a career within the Health or
													Social Services Sector .</p>
												<p>“The development of occupational qualifications that are relevant
													to the labour market underpins the activities of the QDM
													sub-division and it is this thinking that drives us to achieve
													targets that will positively impact the health and social
													development sectors in the country,” concludes Ms Gopal.</p>

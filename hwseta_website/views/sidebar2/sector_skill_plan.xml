												<p>The Sector Skills Plan (SSP) Update is an annual report approved
													by the HWSETA board which is constituted by representatives from
													labour, employers and government (Department of Social Development,
													Department of Health). The annual update is aimed at providing
													current sector skills development needs initially set out in the
													Five Year Sector Skills Plan. Furthermore, it is aimed at aligning
													sector-based skills needs and programmes with governmentâ€™s economic
													and social development priorities enshrined in the New Growth Path
													(hereafter NGP) and Medium Term Strategic Framework (hereafter
													MTSF).</p>
												<p>It also grapples with requirements set out by the Department of
													Higher Education and Training in the National Skills Development
													Strategy III (hereafter NSDS III). That said, it is assuring that
													this journal will provide a useful source of information for the
													HWSETA, stakeholders and wider audience, moving forward.</p>
